//  LANGGRAPH ARCHITECTURAL ANALYSIS
//
// ===================================================================================
/*
    ARCHITECTURAL INSIGHTS FOR FUTURE AI ANALYSIS:
    This file visualizes a hierarchical agent team architecture, a sophisticated pattern for solving complex problems by delegating tasks to specialized sub-teams. This approach, inspired by the AutoGen paper, uses LangGraph's ability to compose graphs to create a scalable and modular agentic system.

    **Overall Architectural Philosophy:**
    The core idea is "divide and conquer." A top-level orchestrator (or supervisor) doesn't solve the problem itself but routes tasks to the appropriate sub-team. Each sub-team is itself a LangGraph graph, containing its own supervisor and a set of specialized worker agents with specific tools. This creates a clear separation of concerns, allowing for more focused agents and easier debugging and expansion.

    **Key Components and Their Roles:**
    - **Code/Logic Components (Green):**
        - `Super-Graph (Orchestrator)`: The top-level `StateGraph`. Its primary job is to analyze the user's request and delegate it to the correct sub-team (`Research Team` or `Writing Team`). It does not have any tools of its own, apart from the ability to "route" or "send" tasks.
        - `Conditional Edge (Routing Function)`: The decision-making logic for all supervisors. These functions inspect the current `GraphState` (specifically, the list of messages and the `next` requested agent) to determine which node to execute next. This is how the orchestrator delegates to teams and how team supervisors delegate to their workers.
        - `Research Team (Sub-Graph)`: A nested `StateGraph` focused on gathering information.
            - `Research Supervisor`: The internal manager for the research team. It decides whether to use the `Search Node` or the `Scrape Node` based on the task it receives from the orchestrator.
            - `Search Node`: A worker agent that uses the `Tavily Search` tool to find URLs and initial information.
            - `Scrape Node`: A worker agent that uses a web scraper tool to get detailed content from the URLs found by the search agent.
        - `Writing Team (Sub-Graph)`: A nested `StateGraph` focused on creating and modifying documents.
            - `Writing Supervisor`: The internal manager for the writing team. It delegates tasks to the `Note Taker`, `Doc Writer`, or `Chart Generator`.
            - `Note Taker Node`: A worker agent that can create outlines.
            - `Doc Writer Node`: A worker agent that can write, read, and edit documents.
            - `Chart Generator Node`: A worker agent that can execute Python code (via a REPL tool) to generate charts or perform data analysis.

    - **Data/Schema Components (Purple):**
        - `GraphState (TypedDict)`: A shared state schema that includes `messages` and a `next` field. The `messages` list accumulates the history of the entire interaction, including outputs from all agents. The `next` field is used by supervisors to specify the next worker or team to be activated.

    - **UI/IO Components (Blue):**
        - `User Input`: The initial high-level task or question.
        - `Final Output`: The result returned by the `Super-Graph` after the teams have completed their work.

    - **Service Components (Red):**
        - `LLM`: The core intelligence for all agents (supervisors and workers). It's used for planning, tool selection, and generating responses.
        - `Tavily Search`: An external web search API used by the Research Team.
        - `File System / Python REPL`: Local services used by the Writing Team to create files and execute code.

    **The Hierarchical Control and Data Flow:**
    1.  **Invocation:** A user provides a complex task (e.g., "Research topic X and write a report with a chart").
    2.  **Orchestration:** The `Super-Graph` supervisor receives the task. It uses the LLM to decide which team is best suited to start (e.g., `Research Team`). It updates the `next` field in the state to "research_team".
    3.  **Delegation to Team:** The graph's conditional edge reads the `next` field and routes control to the `Research Team` sub-graph.
    4.  **Internal Team Management:** The `Research Supervisor` now takes over. It analyzes the task and decides which of its workers should act first (e.g., `Search Node`). It sets the `next` state field to "search".
    5.  **Worker Execution:** The graph routes to the `Search Node`, which executes its search tool. The results are added to the `messages` in the `GraphState`.
    6.  **Looping within Team:** Control returns to the `Research Supervisor`. It sees the search results and may decide to delegate to the `Scrape Node` for more detail, or it might decide its task is complete. If the task is complete, it sets `next` to "FINISH".
    7.  **Return to Orchestrator:** When a team supervisor routes to "FINISH", control returns to the top-level `Super-Graph` supervisor.
    8.  **Cross-Team Delegation:** The `Super-Graph` supervisor now sees the research results and the original request. It decides the next step is to write a document, so it sets `next` to "writing_team".
    9.  **Second Team Execution:** The process repeats, with the `Writing Team` supervisor now delegating to its `Note Taker`, `Doc Writer`, and `Chart Generator` agents as needed.
    10. **Finalization:** Once the `Writing Team` finishes and returns control, the `Super-Graph` supervisor determines the overall task is complete and routes to `END`, returning the final result.

    This hierarchical structure is extremely powerful for building complex, robust, and maintainable AI systems.
